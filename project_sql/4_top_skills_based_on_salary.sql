Top-Level Trends
1. DevOps & Infrastructure Tools Dominate High Pay
    - Examples: svn ($400K), terraform, ansible, puppet, gitlab, vmware, airflow

    - Why? These tools manage cloud infrastructure, deployment, and automation. Companies pay a premium for DevOps skills that ensure systems scale smoothly and stay reliable.

2. AI/ML & Deep Learning is Hot
    - Examples: datarobot, keras, pytorch, tensorflow, hugging face, mxnet

    - Why? These are core to building predictive models and generative AI. Specialized frameworks in deep learning are in demandâ€”especially those for NLP (Hugging Face) and DL (Keras/PyTorch).

3. Blockchain & Smart Contracts Rising
    - Example: solidity ($179K)

    - Why? Solidity is used in Ethereum smart contracts. As Web3, crypto, and DeFi evolve, developers who can build secure contracts are highly valued.

4. Programming Languages Still Powerhouse
    - Examples: golang, scala, perl, python (implied via PyTorch, TensorFlow)

    - Why? Efficient, scalable backend code is needed for both ML pipelines and high-performance systems.

5. Cloud & Big Data Tools
    - Examples: kafka, cassandra, airflow

    - Why? Handling large-scale, real-time data is a major need. Skills here support pipelines and data engineering for analysts and scientists.
